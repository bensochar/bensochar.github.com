Taking an idea from [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2015). Books I read in 2015.

#### Recommended:

* _Devil in the White City_ - Erik Larson. Best book I've read in years. I enjoyed the history & Culture of the Chicago world's fair more than the parts about the serial killer.
* _Doc_ - Mary Doria Russell. Excellent book about Doc Holliday & Wyatt Earp's days in Dodge City.
* _Scorecasting: The Hidden Influences Behind How Sports Are Played and Games_ - Tobias Moskowitz & L. Jon Wertheim. [Here is a NPR story about the book](http://www.npr.org/2011/01/29/133280133/scorecasting-the-new-freakonomics-of-sports).
* _How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend_ - The Monks of New Skeet
* _Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk_ - Ben Fountain. Update: Its now a movie with Steve Martin. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=oD5WhVcuxBo

* _The Martian_ - Andy Weir. Who hasn't read this?
* _Ruby on Rails Guide_ - [Various](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/credits.html).
* _The Hemmingway Hoax_ - Joe Halderman
* _The Thinker's Toolkit: 14 Powerful Techniques for Problem Solving_ - Morgan D. Jones. This was required reading in my old Infomatics 101 course. It was definetly worth revisting.


#### Not Bad:

* _Seven Eves_ - Neal Stephenson. [NPR Review](http://www.npr.org/2015/05/20/407079232/seveneves-blows-up-the-moon-and-thats-just-the-beginning). Long & the 'twist' was easy to to see coming. Update: [Bill Gates liked it more than I did](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Seveneves).
* _11/2/63_ - Stephen King. Way too long.
* _Dune_ - Frank Herbert.
* _The Basics of Web Hacking_ - Josh Pauli
* _Galapogos Incident_ - Felix R Savage
* _Preacher Book One_ - Gareth Ennis
* _Comeback_ - Dennis Conner. The backstory on the America's Cup was excellent.


### Insufferable:

* _The Transhumaist Wager_ - Zoltan Istvan. I hate not finishing books but was glad to put this down.

Pavan Sangria Challenge
The Challenge? Share your sangria recipe. This call was answered by 100+ bartenders. Winners were chosen by the Pavan marketing team.

* Custom PHP app.
* Posted to a Google Doc for an ad-hoc admin to meet the deadline.
* But contest grew so much that it eventually needed a ‘real’ admin. So I built that.
* Scroll animation like, Whoa!
* Client-side & server-side form validation.
* Custom Facebook book page with portions of the contest embeded.

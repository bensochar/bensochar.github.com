FX Networks wanted to promote the new show *Man Seeking Woman* with a unique placement on their homepage. The placement mimics Tinder inviting the user to swipe left or right on cast members.

* Worked with FXâ€™s developers to integrate my code seamlessly.
* Participated in design & concept to ensure our concept worked across many devices
* Ensured our concept could meet a strict deadline.
* The experience adapts to device size & touch capabilities.

The deadline for delivery was crushed & the FX dev team was able to easily integrate the code. Concept by @calliepeck.

SLS Hotels wanted a modern site representing their rebranding/remodel of The Sands hotel & casino.

* Customized Wordpress back end with modular custom fields.
* Wordpress Rest API feeds data to an Angular front end.
* Rewrites and 3rd party services, prerender.io, retained SEO expectations.
* Admins can select Twitter and Instagram posts from a live feed for each brand on property.
* Maintained revenue tracking in a SPA.

Learned a lot from crack developer, @jmparsons. Maintained by the professor, @chrisltd.

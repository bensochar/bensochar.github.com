Council of Fashion Designers of America needed a new online presence that could be updated by their staff.

* Customized Wordpress backend with custom post types and post meta.
* Framework for creating one-off landing pages for events.
* Integrated social media & sharable content.
* Creation of 'live' blogging pages for Fashion Week & CFDA awards show.

Worked with the excellent @williameliel, maintained by [@waine_joe](https://twitter.com/waine_joe).

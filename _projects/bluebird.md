* I created a server setup & deployment that could handle millions of visitors.
* Custom PHP app routed content & simplified continuous improvement.
* Met strict standards for ADA accessibility, SEO, & Page Speed.
* Passed AMEX security tests.
* Setup alerts, logs & worked round the clock with AMEX/Serve’s NOC to prevent downtime.
* I contributed to design & UX/UI for both website & mobile apps.
* Responsible for asset creation for the Bluebird iOS & Android mobile app.
* Worked with consultants at Omniture, AMEX DNS services & DoubleClick.
* Directed design updates sent to client.
* Estimated updates & created delivery timelines for client.
* Optimized simutanous updates between mutiple SVN branches for efficiency.

Bluebird was a success so AMEX came back to relaunch Serve. The goal was a redesigned, modernized responsive site.

* Static page automagically generated with a custom Silex app.
* Painfully integrated years worth of legacy code from the old site.
* Custom JavaScript powered FAQ search.
* Ultra finite user tracking. I could tell you which question in the FAQs was scrolled to the most.
* Integration of 3rd party revenue tracking.
* Met the strict standards for AMEX accessibility, page load & SEO.

The serve.com relauch resulted in more conversrions & less customer support calls.

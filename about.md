#### Me:
Experienced full-stack web developer & tech lead always eager for more.

I've estimated, planned & managed projects from Fortune 500 companies, multi-platnuim selling musicans & startups. Lead dev teams here & guided teams offshore. I love working with people to produce effective sites.

I <3 fast, modular sites that follow logic (who doesn't, amirite). Sites that are accessible for everyone & respond to users. As a former desinger, I enjoy working with UX, UI & designers to create a clean  project that meets a deadline.

I studied Studio Art & Art History @IUBloomington. While working as an Jr Art director I began learning Flash & Actionscript. From there I learned PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML, Javascript. Recently I took the Ruby on Rails course at General Assembly. I picked up a lot in my 8 years.

When I’m not developing I’m playing with my dog, Duffy.
